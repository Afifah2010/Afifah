I had the pleasure of learning about Dreamers Academy from a friend and it has proven to be a valuable resource in my coding journey. Prior to attending Thistley Hough Academy, I studied at Viqarunnisa Noon School and College in Bangladesh. During my time there, I also completed several sessions at the British Council and participated in various competitions and studies at ALOHA Bangladesh from 2017 to 2019.

	I am proud to say that in 2019, I won the Grand Champion in Arithmetic at Marco Polo in Guangzhou, China. My experiences have taught me the value of hard work and dedication, and I am excited to continue my journey in the world of coding with the help of Dreamers Academy. </p>
